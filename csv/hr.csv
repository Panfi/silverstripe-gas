						<ul>
							<li>Correct camber for perfect alignment</li>							<li>Wide adjustment range +/- 0 to 3º </li>							<li>Easy to install, simple to use </li>													</ul>
						Consisting of a pair of specially-designed bolts, H&amp;R patented ‘Triple C’ Camber Adjustment Bolts replace the original upper fastening bolts on McPherson strut applications. As the bolt is turned, a small cam eccentric alters the vehicle’s camber, allowing adjustments from 0-3 degrees, positive or negative.<br>
<br>
When you lower a vehicle’s ride height, negative camber is increased — how much depends on the vehicle and the reduction in ride height. H&amp;R ‘Triple C’ Camber Adjustment Bolts are a simple, yet very effective means of removing excessive camber, adjusting your vehicle’s camber settings, or even correcting small side-to-side camber variations for precise alignment.<br>
<br>
Installation takes only minutes with readily available hand tools, and benefits include increased tire life, improved tracking and the ability to dial in more camber for weekend track events.
