Rotary forging produces wheels that are uncommonly lightweight. That’s because the manufacturing process alters the molecular structure of the aluminum alloy in a way that increases its strength. That strength allows TSW engineers to reduce the thickness of the outer barrel reducing rotational mass. Even the largest Bathurst size 20x10.5 weighs less than 25 lbs.; Just as innovative as its manufacturing process is the Bathurst’s design a brilliant starburst of ten ultra narrow beveled spokes that is as visually light as its actual weight. The Bathurst is stunning executed in silver with a mirror cut face or a spectacular gloss gunmetal. In a nod to TSW’s racing heritage the new wheel is named for the Bathurst 1000kM race regarded as the pinnacle of Australian motorsports.; The Bathurst is available in multiple widths in diameters including 1718 19 and 20 inches. Multiple widths make possible a staggered fitment which involves rear wheels slightly wider than front wheels. Staggered fitments combine the visual appeal of a more aggressive stance with added traction under cornering and acceleration achieved through mounting wider tires.; * The Bathurst is manufactured using a highly advanced production technique called Rotary Forging. The rim of the wheels is forged at high pressure while the wheel is spun at high speed. This alters the molecular structure and enhances the strength of the alloy. The benefit is a much lighter weight than a regular cast wheel. Most importantly the weight saving is in the outer rim of the wheel which dramatically reduces rotational mass and enhances vehicle performance.^@^17x8 17x9 18x8 18x8.5 18x9 18x9.5 18x10.5 19x8 19x8.5 19x9 19x9.5 19x10.5 20x8.5 20x9 20x10 20x10.5; 17.95 19.2 18.6 19.5 19.4 21.05 21.25 20.55 21.4 21.9 22.5 22.4 23 24.7 24.45 24.45^@@@^<ul id="wheel-finishes" class="group"> <li><a href="javascript:void(0);" data-finish="Silver w/Mirror Cut Face" data-std="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-silver-machine-std-700.jpg" data-face="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-silver-machine-face-700.jpg" data-lay="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-silver-machine-lay-700.jpg"><img src="http://www.tsw.com/img/alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-silver-machine-std-100.jpg" alt="TSW Bathurst Alloy Wheels Silver w/Mirror Cut Face" /><br />Silver w/Mirror Cut Face</a></li><li><a href="javascript:void(0);" data-finish="Gloss Gunmetal" data-std="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-matte-black-std-700.jpg" data-face="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-matte-black-face-700.jpg" data-lay="alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-matte-black-lay-700.jpg"><img src="http://www.tsw.com/img/alloy-wheels-rims-tsw-bathurst-5-lug-matte-black-std-100.jpg" alt="TSW Bathurst Alloy Wheels Gloss Gunmetal" /><br />Gloss Gunmetal</a></li> </ul>^

It is available in gloss black with a mirror face and in an innovative matte gunmetal finish.; The Chicane is available in 17x8 18x8 18x9.5 19x8 19x9.5 20x8.5 and 20x10. The multiple widths in 18 19 and 20-inch diameters make possible a staggered fitment which involves rear wheels which are slightly wider than front wheels. Staggered fitments have become quite common in OE applications both for the visual appeal of a more aggressive stance and for the added traction under cornering and acceleration achieved through mounting wider tires.; Like all TSW wheels the Chicane is hub centric meaning the center bore diameter is determined by the year make and model vehicle for a snug fit over the vehicle’s hub resulting in a smooth vibration free ride.^@^17x8 18x8.5 18x9.5 19x8.5 19x9.5 20x8.5 20x10^@@@
