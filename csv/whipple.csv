Get the industries most efficient and latest designed twin-screw supercharger available today. The new Whipple-Ford Racing system can produce incredible power levels with stock 4.6L Cobra engines as well as highly modified engines. The revolutionary new W140ax compressor has the ability to run nearly 25lbs of boost (engine modifications required) for unheralded performance.</p> <p>This direct bolt-on replacement system dramatically lowers supercharger air temperatures and power consumption (hp) versus the factory Eaton roots-type supercharger. The complete bolt-on system comes with all the necessary parts for 13lbs of boost which requires zero modifications to the engine or PCM. The Whipple-Ford Racing system is available in two styles one for the factory throttle body and one for aftermarket throttle bodies such as Billet Flow’s and Accufabs. </p> <p>Other companies make false claims and inaccurate judgments regarding supercharger efficiency and kits. It’s a simple fact that the Whipple Supercharger produces more air per rpm at lower temps and lower parasitic losses. The factory engine can run up to 17psi on pump gas while modified engines can run up to 25psi.</p> <p>The Whipple-Ford Racing Cobra kit not only offers a better supercharger but the potential to have one of the fastest most powerful street machines on the road today. The Whipple discharge plate offers far more plenum area as well as a much greater radius to help distribute the air evenly over the entire intercooler core. Whipple’s air bypass system was also properly engineered into the SC discharge for proper function unlike other systems. This allows lower discharge temps and less parasitic losses during operation.

Whipple Superchargers has yet again set a new precedence for bolt-on power and industry leading durability.</p> <p>Nobody puts more time and resources into the development then Whipple. The proof is in the product more power per lb of boost than any other system. The key to making such incredible reliable power is in the Whipple unique twin screw supercharger massive air-to-water intercooler oversized Crusher air system and innovative PCM programming that keeps the power-train safe and secure. Whether you’re looking for a daily driver that needs a little more punch or you’re craving a tire-frying rubber shredding street machine the Whipple Supercharger systems delivers like no other Superharger System today. Power from tip in to redline the new Whipple Superharger System makes incredible power across the entire rpm range while maintaining industry leading drive-ability.</p> <p>With years of OEM and racing experience Whipple engineers have developed a unique PCM calibration that reconfigures all the necessary engine functions including fuel spark knock detection torque management transmission control and electronic throttle control. The vehicles PCM constantly monitors the engines torque output while monitoring many different parameters to keep the engine in it’s ideal parameters. If a parameter falls below specification the PCM will lower boost and torque output until the problem can be cured. No other calibration in the field has such technology giving the Whipple Superharger System unheralded performance and reliability.</p> ^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/thumbnails/0/400/2015-ford-f-150-front-side-view-in-snow.jpg^@@

Do you want to take your crate ZZ4 to 500 horsepower on pump gas? Do you have a custom built 383 or 427 that needs another 50+% more power? How about an all out race motor for your Nova or Chevelle? Maybe you already have a 671 style sc and want a boost in power without running more boost. If so Whipple’s latest developments will fit your needs. The all new W200 and W305 series superchargers will truly revolutionize supercharging as we know it. The massive twin screw superchargers not only offer incredible power levels but also reliable and consistent power levels that are typically unheard of.

The W200 kits come with intake manifold (traditional and Vortec style) and optional intercooler while the massive 305 bolts to existing 671 manifolds and carb adapters. </p> <p>The W200 kits offer a great range for any shade-tree mechanic as well as the ultimate muscle car builders. Whether you want 300 to 900hp the W200 supercharger can deliver you the air in one of the most efficienct methods possible. Whipple also offers a sleek aluminum air-to-water intercooler** that only adds 1.25” in height. This fits snuggly between the SC and intake manifold giving you more power with increased reliability. The Whipple system is also very modular allowing customers to use traditional v-belt accessories or the later generation serpentine belt systems allowing you to truly customize your system. </p> <p>The W305 supercharger pumps 5.0 liters of air per revolution and operating ranges up to 18000rpm. The W305R is a blend of old-school fitment with new age technology. Within a few hours this massive supercharger offers a direct bolt-on replacement for 671-1471 style superchargers. The W305’s offer superior adiabatic and thermal efficiency for far greater power gains than any roots-type supercharger yet they don’t need Teflon strips or constant rebuilding. In some cases gains of nearly 30% can be achieved by simply using the twin-screw advantage! Gains are achieved by lower parasitic losses increased thermal efficiency and far better fuel distribution. </p> <p>The revolutionary superchargers offer a standard 671 style drive snout system to work with traditional 8mm and 14mm systems an externally mounted air-bypass system for industry leading idle qualities and fuel economy Teflon coated rotors for increased airflow extreme duty roller bearings precision cut helical gears oil sight glass for easy inspection and a universal 671 style mounting flange.</p> <p></p> ^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/thumbnails/0/400/smallblock_Large13195233284ea654007fbb0.jpg^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/detailed/0/smallblock_Large13195233284ea654007fbb0.jpg; http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/detailed/0/smallblock_Large.jpg; http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/detailed/0/smallblock2_Large.jpg^@

This is due to the high adiabatic (up to 80%) and volumetric efficiency levels (up to 99.9%). The Whipple screw compressor is the latest generation durable and dependable performance-enhancing item ever designed for either low boost or high boost levels. Available in a complete unit or a “rotor assembly” for builders own housings. </p> <p>The screw compressor is by far the best supercharger available today; it’s the only supercharger to provide a positive displacement design for maximum low-end torque as well as high efficiency for maximum top-end horsepower. No other supercharger in the world can offer the same unique benefits. Centrifugals and turbos have tremendous lag time during shift points on-off throttle and off the line boost. Roots-type superchargers have been proven to not be very efficient especially at higher boost levels. Whipple Superchargers has a variety of screw compressors for all types of applications anywhere from a 100 cubic inch compressor to the 510 cubic inch compressor. Whipple also has a wide assortment of drive lengths pulley combinations and bypass valves for all types of applications. </p> <p></p> ^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/thumbnails/0/400/105_104_103_102_101_100_99_rotors.gif^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/detailed/0/105_104_103_102_101_100_99_rotors.gif^@

When building a system for the consumers you must provide a very broad power ban with a high peak horsepower level only the screw compressor can give you this. This is due to the high adiabatic (up to 80%) and volumetric efficiency levels (up to 99.9%). The Whipple screw compressor is the latest generation durable and dependable performance-enhancing item ever designed for either low boost or high boost levels. Available in a complete unit or a “rotor assembly” for builders own housings. </p> <p>The screw compressor is by far the best supercharger available today; it’s the only supercharger to provide a positive displacement design for maximum low-end torque as well as high efficiency for maximum top-end horsepower. No other supercharger in the world can offer the same unique benefits. Centrifugals and turbos have tremendous lag time during shift points on-off throttle and off the line boost. Roots-type superchargers have been proven to not be very efficient especially at higher boost levels. Whipple Superchargers has a variety of screw compressors for all types of applications anywhere from a 100 cubic inch compressor to the 510 cubic inch compressor. Whipple also has a wide assortment of drive lengths pulley combinations and bypass valves for all types of applications. </p> <p></p> ^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/thumbnails/0/400/107_106_105_104_103_102_101_100_99_rotors.gif^@^http://whipplesuperchargers.com/images/detailed/0/107_106_105_104_103_102_101_100_99_rotors.gif^@
